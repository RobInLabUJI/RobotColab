# RobotColab

RobotColab is a repository of [Colaboratory notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) for learning to program robots.

Colab notebooks are [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) hosted in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). You can learn more about the Jupyter project by visiting [jupyter.org](https://www.jupyter.org/).

Notebooks consist of [Python](https://www.python.org/) executable code and rich text in a single document, along with images, [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and more. You can create your own Colab notebooks, store them in your [Google Drive](https://www.google.es/intl/en/drive/) account, and share them with co-workers and friends.

## Your very first Colab notebook

Click on the ["Hello, World" example](https://github.com/RobInLabUJI/RobotColab/blob/main/HelloWorld.ipynb), open it in Colab and feel free to experiment!

## Where is the robot?

Colab notebooks are executed by default in a server [hosted in the Google Cloud](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53894808/what-is-the-difference-between-local-runtime-and-hosted-runtime-in-google-colab).

For using Colab notebooks with a robot, you must connect to [a local runtime](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html?hl=en) in the computer running a robot simulator or controlling a real robot.
